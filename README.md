# 🔐 Web Application Vulnerability Assessment (VAPT) – zero.webappsecurity.com

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **Web Application Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)** conducted on a deliberately vulnerable web application in a controlled lab environment.

The assessment followed the **OWASP Testing Methodology** to identify, validate, and document security vulnerabilities along with remediation recommendations.

> ⚠️ This testing was performed in a safe lab environment for educational purposes only.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Perform reconnaissance and information gathering
* Identify web application vulnerabilities
* Validate critical findings through proof-of-concept
* Classify risks using CVSS scoring
* Provide remediation recommendations

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Nmap** – Network scanning and service enumeration
* **Burp Suite** – Interception, manipulation, and manual testing
* **Nikto** – Web server vulnerability scanning
* **Browser Developer Tools** – Client-side analysis
* **OWASP Top 10 Framework** – Vulnerability classification

---

## 🔎 Testing Methodology

### 1️⃣ Reconnaissance & Enumeration

* Identified open ports and running services
* Analyzed application structure and endpoints
* Enumerated directories and hidden resources

### 2️⃣ Vulnerability Identification

Discovered and validated vulnerabilities including:

* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Broken Access Control
* Security Misconfigurations
* Information Disclosure

### 3️⃣ Risk Assessment

* Categorized vulnerabilities according to **OWASP Top 10**
* Assigned severity using **CVSS scoring system**
* Assessed impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability

---

## 📊 Key Findings

The assessment revealed multiple vulnerabilities that could lead to:

* Unauthorized data access
* Session hijacking
* Account takeover
* Database compromise
* Privilege escalation

---

## 🛡 Remediation Recommendations

* Implement parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection
* Apply input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS
* Enforce proper access control mechanisms
* Harden server configuration
* Disable unnecessary services and verbose error messages
* Regularly update and patch application dependencies
